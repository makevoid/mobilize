# Mobilize

This is an experiment on creating the basic building blocks for a mini-framework to develop mobile web apps like jQtouch or SenchaTouch. 

### features:

- Use .page elements to define app pages
- Animate pages with a CSS "sliding" transition
- Use "touchEnd" event other than "click" event to respond to taps instantly (this is a feature I miss from existing frameworks)

### core points:

- simplicity
- responsiveness


### todo:

- Create a task to generate static HTML files from Haml files
